# Hello, my name is Sava

I'm a self-taught 17 year old developer, who doesn't specialize in particular domain yet. 
I tried basic **GameDev** ([SavaCrush](https://github.com/Sava2008/Sava-Crush)), **scripting** and **automation** ([SavaRun](https://github.com/Sava2008/SavaRun)), and **desktop development** ([Interactive dictionary](https://github.com/Sava2008/Interactive-dictionary-code)). 
I have a python background üêç and am a novice in rust ü¶Ä. I use AI considerately, asking for hints, rather than for generating 
complete snippets of code for myself.
